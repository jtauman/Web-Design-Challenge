# Web-Design-Challenge

This challenge consisted of creating a dashboar to share the data analysis performed for the Weather by Latitude portion of the API challenge (https://github.com/jtauman/python-api-challenge).

The dashboard uses html, css, and bootstrap to present visualizations from the Weather by Latitude project.  In addition, brief descriptions of the analyses conducted and the data trends observed are included with each visualiation.  Finally, the raw data used for the analysis is located on a separate data page.  

The dashboard can be found at: https://jtauman.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/
